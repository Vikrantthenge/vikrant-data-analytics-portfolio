# 👋 Hi, I'm Vikrant

I'm a strategic data analyst with a background in airline operations, now focused on building recruiter-ready dashboards, predictive models, and automation workflows that deliver measurable impact.

With hands-on expertise in Python, Power BI, and Streamlit, I specialize in transforming raw data into polished, interactive apps—each designed for clarity, speed, and recruiter engagement. My portfolio reflects a deep understanding of both technical execution and visual branding, from error-handled deployments to designer thumbnails and live app links.
